This challenge looks at performing a climate analysis to help with planning a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. It consists of two parts:

Part 1: Analysing and axploring the climate data using Python and SQLAlchemy to perform analysis and exploration of the climate database. The climate data can be found in the Resources folder. The complete analysis can be found in the climate.ipynb file. 

Part 2: Designing a climate App that creates a Flask API based on the queries that were developed in part 1 of this challenge.
